# BoardGameProject

It is my old project with lots of memory leaks.
I will try to fix them all :D

- Description

This is a computer board game (meant to be a RPG) made using SFML and my game engine.
It has a lot of memory leaks that make building game in release mode impossible.
There is also scripting language which is a little bit messy. I needs to be refreshed.

## TO DO:
- Split Game and Editor into separate projects [âœ“]
- Move project from Visual Studio to CMake [ ]
- Connect project with SFML repository [ ]
- Refactor all the code [ ]
- Find and fix all incorrect memory allocations [ ]
- Build project with MinGW [ ]
- Take a look at scripting language and find better solutions [ ]
